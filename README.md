# huh
the above images probably don't make sense to normal people so here's a breakdown of some of the complex jargon you see above
- iu - a cool person
- bol - me; also a cool person
- pc - photocard; or a mugshot if you're american (*im kidding don't cancel me*)
- hotel - trivago

# ok now what
so with one week left to my finals i did what any responsible cs student would do. even though this project sounded interesting, i had to prioritise my exams. so i ended up diligently studying the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) wait what

# IUFI
IUFI is a Discord bot game that lets fans of [IU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) collect virtual photocards (*think trading card games*). It is built off the discord.py Python library, with AWS S3 as the file storage and MongoDB as the database.

# guide
~~i held a random Discord user at gunpoint~~ a fellow fan helped to create a comprehensive [beginner's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VAD20wZQ56S_wDeMJlwIKn_jImIPuxh2lgy1fn17z0c/edit) so have a look there for more details about the game.

# ok but where the game
the bot has been deployed in the main [IU fan discord server](https://discord.gg/b4Dzpnpg5D) with over 10k members (*ok there's actually only 200 registered players but*). overall the game has been pretty successful but don't take my word for it, have a look at what the players themselves have to say:

# ok in all seriousness
this project took over a month and i'm glad to be able to put out a game that fellow fans can enjoy ~~and lose sleep over~~
